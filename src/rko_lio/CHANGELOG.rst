0.1.2 (2025-09-26)
------------------
* Drop irregular lidar frames (`#35 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/35>`_)
  * if incoming lidar scan has a stamp with too big of a delta to the previous, we treat it as an error
* fix component registration so online node component shows up in ros2 component types (`#34 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/34>`_)
* Contributors: Meher Malladi

0.1.1 (2025-09-17)
------------------
* Fix logic error in offline node (ros) and interval imu stats compute (core) (`#29 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/29>`_)
  * cleaner error messages and log parsed imu and lidar frames for ros
  * patch rviz config to change the global frame if a different odom frame is used
  * revert offline node bag and buffer completion handling logic
  * cannot compute accel mag variance if imu count is 1. modify the check preventing divide by 0 errors
  * remove python/config/default.yaml since --dump_config does the same job
  * bump version to v0.1.1 and update python readme slightly
* fix: ros launch - correctly overload config file params with cli params (`#28 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/28>`_)
  * fix: ros launch - correctly overload config file params with cli params
  * clarify that the default.yaml config file is not automatically picked up by the ros launch file
  * add a check to make sure 0 or both extrinsics are specified
* Update docs to specify more details on data format (`#25 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/25>`_)
  * print the extrinsics to console after guessing them, so that its easier for the user to respecify in a config if required
  * add a data.md that specifies the minimal requirements on data we have.
  * add a readme section for all the configurations rko lio has been tested on
* Update defaults to provide an easier entry into using the system (`#24 <https://github.com/PRBonn/rko_lio/issues/24>`_)
  * set initialization_phase to false by default, as a false start can break odometry. the user can opt-in to initializing if they know their system starts from rest.
  * remove Ninja as the default generator for ROS builds, as it breaks ros build farm builds

  * append quat_xyzw_xyz to extrinsic parameter names to make the order clearer
  * rename bag_filename to bag_path to be more intuitive on the offline node
  * ros refactoring: more parameter definitions, better parameter defaults, better variable names, offline node simplifications, and readme and launfile updates to reflect the new parameter names.
  * update the rviz config file
  * launchfile is improved. cli params override config files. final config is printed to console
