  # the ros build farm uses this option to perform an isolated build. but as per
  # the author of FetchContent himself, this is an abuse of the flag. See
  # https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/17075 and
  # https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/25946. Nevertheless this is
  # a problem for us since Bonxai is not part of rosdistro yet. See here for
  # progress: https://github.com/facontidavide/Bonxai/issues/55. Since a user
  # can use this flag as valid behavior, the following is my best attempt at
  # catching the specific situation in the build farm. Hopefully soon enough, i
  # can remove this hack and stop vendoring bonxai code in my own repository.
